# AGENTS.md

Instructions for autonomous coding agents working in this repository.

## Scope

- Applies to all agent-driven work in this repo.
- If multiple instruction files exist, follow the most specific one for the
  files you are editing.

## Required Git Rules

1. Commit every turn.
1. Do not amend commits.
1. Do not change branches without explicit user permission.

## Commit Expectations

- Keep commits focused and related to the requested task.
- Use clear commit messages.
- Do not push, pull, or rebase unless explicitly requested.

## Validation

- Run relevant tests before committing when practical.
- If tests cannot be run, state that clearly in the handoff.

## Safety

- Do not revert user-authored or unrelated local changes unless explicitly
  requested.
- Avoid destructive git commands unless explicitly requested.

## Data Safety

The SQLite database is a persistent archive. Never delete or recreate it to
handle data version changes. Schema changes use ALTER TABLE; parser changes
trigger a full resync (build fresh DB, sync files, copy orphaned sessions from
old DB, atomic swap). Existing session data must be preserved even when source
files no longer exist on disk.
